# Project Description

Delphi, is offering a messaging platform to better keep friends engaged in each
other’s lives, because we’re all getting out of touch with friends as we age.
Existing communication solutions lack the prioritization of friends you haven’t talked to in a while,
and it can be hard to come up with conversation starters for distant friends.
Delphi keeps conversation frequent and fluid by suggesting relevant conversation starters like
articles and memes based on your unique conversation histories. Log on today and reignite your
meaningful relationships.

## Walkthrough
Maintaining friendships with busy lives is challenging, especially with long-distance friends. Unlike
instant messaging applications where the user actively engages with their friends, Delphi’s mission
is to nudge users to engage with their long-distance friends by recommending conversation starters
based on keywords of their chat history. For the purpose of our application, Delphi recommends
basketball related content because of the basketball related messages in the chat history.
Here is how the app works… The user logs-into the application with his Facebook account then
chooses to chat with Benjamin, the user then engages either by sending a text message or a
recommended article or meme.
Delphi spurs users to actively engage with their long-distance friends by intelligently recommending
content related to their chat history.

## Post Mortem by Yi
I learned that working in a team of 2 can be challenging in terms all the requirements of each
assignment, especially with the coding parts of the project. On the other hand, being only 2 people,
helped our team in terms of scheduling meetings and emphasized our ability to prioritize and
complete work efficiently.
If I had to do it all over again, we would have like to worked more on the algorithm for recommending
content based on the chat history. Although, that seems a more advanced and arduous time, our
team would have liked to spend more time on that. Being a team of 2, we focused more on
conveying and displaying our idea into a prototype, rather than generating recommender algorithms.
Our team has been mostly successful when planning and prioritizing tasks demonstrated by the
good scores in most of our assignments. The only mistakes were when we started coding the
application and we ran into bugs during the assignment due date. Starting a couple of days earlier
could have mitigated this issue.

## Post Mortem by Alex
I learnt that seeking help early from teaching assistants especially during the coding phase of
the project was helpful to debug and solve issues about the project. Starting earlier on the
assignment would have also been beneficial in avoiding last minute stress, especially when
encountered with bugs in the project. I also learnt that planning early will save time later,
especially during midterm weeks when time is limited and a lot of work has to be completed.
If I had to do it all over again, I would have chosen an idea that has a greater chance of
innovation. I think that instant messengers are saturated in development.
I think our team’s mistake was thinking that we would have made an artificial algorithm for the
project and that was ultimately out the scope of the class. Successful planning and execution
occurred when other events spurred our team to work earlier.
